    Given a list of names, like::

      bagon baltoy yamask starly nosepass kalob nicky

    Do the following:

    1. Always start with the first word ("bagon", in this example).

    2. Add it to the results.

    3. Use the last letter of that word to look for the next word.
       Since "bagon" ends with n, find the *first* word starting
       with "n" in our list --- in this case, "nosepass".

    4. Add "nosepass" to the results, and continue. Once a word has
       been used, it can't be used again --- so we'll never get to
       use "bagon" or "nosepass" a second time.

    5. When you can't find an unused word to use, you're done!
       Return the list of output words.

    For example::

        >>> kids_game(["bagon", "baltoy", "yamask", "starly",
        ...            "nosepass", "kalob", "nicky", "booger"])

    (After "baltoy", there are no more y-words, so we end, even
    though "nicky" and "booger" weren't used.)

    This is a tricky problem. In particular, think about how using
    a dictionary (with the super-fast lookup they provide) can help;
    good solutions here will definitely require a dictionary.
